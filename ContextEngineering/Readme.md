###### Context Engineering

**Context engineering** is the discipline of strategically managing the context window—ensuring the model has access to the most relevant information at every step of an agent's interaction or task execution.

###### Context Challenges and Mitigation Strategies

As input length increases, models can struggle to consistently interpret and prioritize information, leading to a variety of issues collectively referred to as **context degradation**. Below are common problems and their corresponding solutions:

- **Context Rot**  
  As input grows, model performance can degrade due to uneven attention distribution across the context window. This leads to **model drift**—where outputs become less reliable over time.

- **Context Poisoning**  
  Occurs when incorrect or hallucinated information enters the context and is repeatedly reinforced.  
  **Solution:** Implement **context validation**—ensure information is verified before being added to persistent memory or reused.

- **Context Confusion**  
  Happens when irrelevant or extraneous data is included in context, influencing the model to generate suboptimal responses.  
  **Solution:** Use **tool loadouts** and store tool metadata in a **RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)** vector store to dynamically surface only the most relevant tools or information per task.

- **Context Distraction**  
  When accumulated context grows too large, the model may over-prioritize historical data at the expense of more relevant, learned knowledge.  
  **Solutions:**  
  - Apply **context summarization** to condense prior context into more efficient summaries.  
  - Use **context pruning** to remove outdated or conflicting information as newer data arrives.

- **Context Clash**  
  Arises when conflicting data or tool outputs coexist within the same context window.  
  **Solution:** Employ **context quarantine** to separate and isolate incompatible threads of information.

- **Context Offloading**  
  A scalable solution to all the above: offload context from the model’s active window and store it externally for on-demand retrieval (e.g., via **RAG**). This reduces clutter and improves context quality by only reintroducing information when it's truly needed.
